# state-capitol-quiz
web app to gamify my kids learning

Memorization is important but it can be frustrating and boring. To help my kid learn state capitols we decided to make game out of it.

Our game has several modes:
* Easy: pick the state that is highlighted on a map (multiple choice)
* Intermediate: pick the correct state capital for a state shown on the map (multiple choice)
* Hard: type the state capital for a state shown on the map (free response)

Behind the scenes
* we are using the [Wikimedia US map SVG file](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map_(states_only).svg) and highlighting states
* the database includes names of other cities in the same state as "decoy answers"
